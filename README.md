# [Fiu](https://github.com/TheGreatSageEqualToHeaven/Fiu/blob/main/Source.lua)

Pronounced like "Phew". This software aims to provide a decently fast and reliable way of executing Luau bytecode under other Lua environments without the use of `loadstring`. For the purpose of anything from sandboxing to reimplementing arbitrary execution, this should serve your needs.

Fiu does not taint the environment if you pass it a table of functions or a wrapper around `getfenv` using `__index` so it should not deoptimise the environment.

Note that only an interpreter is provided, and compiled code must be obtained from some external source.

Fiu is in a working state but bugs and side effects can be encountered! Open an [issue](https://github.com/TheGreatSageEqualToHeaven/Fiu/issues) if you encounter any breaking issues.

**Vector constants and integer division are currently not supported!**

# Usage
Use `Source.lua` from the repository and set `FIU_DEBUGGING` to false at the top of the file.

- `luau_load(bytecode | chunk, env)` <div>Used to deserialise and interpret code at the same time, bytecode that has already been deserialised can also be passed.</div>
- `luau_deserialize(bytecode)` <div>Used to deserialise bytecode.</div>

# Contributing

- Tests can be added and compiled using CreateTests.lua, Lua with the `io` and `os` library is needed.
- Tests must be ran with Luau using `RunTests.lua`, you can use `allTests` or `specificTests`.
- Contributed code should be consistent with the source.

<div>Luau updates often and Fiu will need to be updated and have working releases added for every new version.</div>
